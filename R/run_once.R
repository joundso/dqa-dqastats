#' @title Perform Data Quality Assessment of Electronic Health Records.
#'
#' @description This function performs a data quality assessment (DQA)
#'   of electronic health records (EHR) in an automatical way.
#'   IMPORTANT Prerequirements:
#'   The .env file with the settings for source and target needs to be stored/
#'   mounted in `/data/input/.env`. Name (= Prefix) of the source system:
#'   `source` and `target` for the target system.
